# AGENTS.md

## Project Purpose

Documentation-only repository for personal consent and data-processing consent statements.

## Repository Layout

- `README.md` — brief repo description
- `twilio.md` — service-specific consent text

## Operating Rules

- Preserve the intent and wording of consent documents unless the user explicitly asks for substantive changes.
- Prefer additive, clearly explained documentation updates over rewrites.
- Do not commit private personal identifiers beyond what the public consent text is meant to disclose.

## Portfolio Standards Reference

For portfolio-wide repository standards and baseline conventions, consult the control-plane repo at `./util-repos/traction-control` from the portfolio root.

Start with:
- `./util-repos/traction-control/AGENTS.md`
- `./util-repos/traction-control/README.md`
- `./util-repos/traction-control/LESSONSLEARNED.md`

Shared implementation repos available portfolio-wide:
- `./util-repos/archility` for architecture toolchain bootstrap/render orchestration, Graphviz-capable diagram support, deterministic starter scaffolding, agentic architecture authoring, and architecture-documentation drift checks
- `./util-repos/auto-pass` for KeePassXC-backed password management and secret retrieval/update flows
- `./util-repos/nordility` for NordVPN-based VPN switching and connection orchestration
- `./util-repos/shock-relay` for external messaging across supported providers such as Signal, Telegram, Twilio SMS, WhatsApp, and Gmail IMAP
- `./util-repos/snowbridge` for SMB-based private file sharing and phone-accessible fileshare workflows
- `./util-repos/short-circuit` for WireGuard VPN setup and configuration, establishing private tunnels with SMB, HTTPS, and SSH access

When another repo needs architecture toolchain bootstrap/rendering, architecture inventory/scaffolding, password management, VPN switching, or external messaging, prefer integrating with these repos instead of re-implementing the capability locally.

## Agent Memory

Use `./LESSONSLEARNED.md` as the tracked durable lessons file for this repo.
Use `./CHATHISTORY.md` as the standard local handoff file for this repo.

- `LESSONSLEARNED.md` is tracked and should capture only reusable lessons.
- `CHATHISTORY.md` is local-only, gitignored, and should capture transient handoff context.
- Read `LESSONSLEARNED.md` and `CHATHISTORY.md` after `AGENTS.md` when resuming work.
- Add durable lessons to `LESSONSLEARNED.md` when they should influence future sessions.
- Keep transient entries brief and focused on document changes, wording decisions, blockers, and next steps.
